# AI-Assisted Task Planner

This is a web-based task planning application that uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate an optimal daily schedule based on user-input tasks. The application is built using **Streamlit** and integrates the OpenAI **GPT-3.5** model for generating task schedules. Users can input tasks, set task priorities, and define available working hours, and the app will generate a detailed task schedule.

## Features
- Input multiple tasks with duration, priority, and task names.
- Define start and end times for the available working hours.
- Generate an AI-assisted, optimized task schedule based on priorities and time constraints.
- Simple, intuitive user interface powered by Streamlit.
